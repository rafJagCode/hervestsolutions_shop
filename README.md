## General Informations

This project is a fully functional e-commerce platform tailored for agricultural products. It is built using a purchased template crafted in Twig and connected to a robust backend developed with Symfony and Mysql based database. I have made several appearance adjustments to the template to better fit the agricultural theme, including custom color schemes, typography, and layout enhancements. Additionally, I have implemented several new features such as advanced filtering options to help users easily find the products they need, making the shopping experience more efficient and user-friendly.
